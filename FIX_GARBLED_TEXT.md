# 🔧 Fix for Garbled Text Issue

## 🚨 **Problem Description**

When uploading **Microsoft Word (.docx) files** or **PDF files**, the text appears garbled with characters like:
- `PK` (ZIP file signature)
- `[Content_Types].xml`
- `word/document.xml`
- `_rels/.rels`
- Various symbols and corrupted characters

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The application is **reading raw file content** instead of **extracting the actual text**:
- `.docx` files are ZIP archives containing XML files
- `.pdf` files have binary content that needs parsing
- Only `.txt` files can be read directly as text

## ✅ **Solution**

### **1. Use the File Handler (Already Implemented)**

The `file_handler.py` already has proper text extraction functions:
- `extract_text_from_pdf()` - Handles PDF files
- `extract_text_from_docx()` - Handles Word documents  
- `extract_text_from_txt()` - Handles text files
- `extract_text()` - Main function that routes to appropriate method

### **2. Integration in Streamlit App**

Replace direct file reading with proper text extraction:

```python
# ❌ WRONG - This causes garbled text
file_content = uploaded_file.read()
text = file_content.decode('utf-8')  # This fails for binary files

# ✅ CORRECT - Use file handler
import tempfile
from file_handler import FileHandler

file_handler = FileHandler()

# Create temporary file
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=f".{uploaded_file.name.split('.')[-1]}") as tmp_file:
    tmp_file.write(uploaded_file.getvalue())
    tmp_file_path = tmp_file.name

try:
    # Extract text using file handler
    success, extracted_text = file_handler.extract_text(tmp_file_path)
    
    if success:
        # Use extracted_text instead of raw file content
        job_description = extracted_text
    else:
        st.error(f"Failed to extract text: {extracted_text}")
        
finally:
    # Clean up temporary file
    if os.path.exists(tmp_file_path):
        os.unlink(tmp_file_path)
```

### **3. Required Dependencies**

Make sure these packages are installed:
```bash
pip install python-docx pdfplumber
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Run the Test Script**
```bash
python test_text_extraction.py
```

### **Expected Output**
```
🧪 Testing Text Extraction Functionality
==================================================

1️⃣ Testing Text File Extraction
✅ Text file extraction successful: This is a sample job description for a Software Engineer position.
```

## 📋 **Files to Update**

### **Main Application (`app.py`)**
- Import `FileHandler` from `file_handler`
- Replace direct file reading with `file_handler.extract_text()`
- Handle temporary files properly

### **Key Changes Made**
1. ✅ Added `from file_handler import FileHandler`
2. ✅ Added `file_handler = FileHandler()`
3. ✅ Added proper text extraction for resume files
4. ✅ Added proper text extraction for job description files
5. ✅ Added temporary file handling

## 🔄 **Workflow After Fix**

### **For Resume Files**
1. User uploads PDF/DOCX/TXT file
2. System creates temporary file
3. `file_handler.extract_text()` processes the file
4. Clean, readable text is extracted
5. Text is displayed in the interface
6. Temporary file is cleaned up

### **For Job Description Files**
1. User uploads PDF/DOCX/TXT file
2. System creates temporary file
3. `file_handler.extract_text()` processes the file
4. Clean, readable text is extracted
5. Text is used for job description
6. Temporary file is cleaned up

## 🎯 **Benefits of the Fix**

- ✅ **Clean Text**: No more garbled characters
- ✅ **Proper Parsing**: Handles all supported file types
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users see actual content, not file structure
- ✅ **Reliability**: Consistent text extraction across file types
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Centralized file handling logic

## 🚀 **Quick Test**

1. **Upload a .docx file** with job description
2. **Check the extracted text** - should be clean and readable
3. **Verify no garbled characters** appear
4. **Test with different file types** (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

## 📞 **If Issues Persist**

1. Check that `python-docx` and `pdfplumber` are installed
2. Verify `file_handler.py` is in the same directory
3. Check file permissions and temporary file creation
4. Review error messages in the console

**Note**: This fix ensures that all uploaded files are properly parsed and their text content is extracted cleanly, eliminating the garbled text issue you experienced.
